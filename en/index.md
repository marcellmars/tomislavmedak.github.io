I'm a PhD researcher at the Coventry Unversity's [Centre for Postdigital Cultures](http://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/areas-of-research/postdigital-cultures/), part of the theory and publishing team of [Multimedia Institute/MAMA](http://www.mi2.hr/en/), amateur librarian for the [Memory of the World/Public library](https://memoryoftheworld.org/) project and member of the performative collective [BADco](http://badco.hr/). My work is primarily driven by the activities of those collective endeavors.

My research interest is in technology, capitalist development and post-capitalist transition, with a particular focus on economies of intellectual property and unevenness of techno-science. Sometimes I also write and present on theatre, dance and politics. In these pages you will find my writings, information on my artistic work and my biography. Links in the sidebar will lead you there.

If you wish to contact me, my details can be found on the [contact page](/en/contact/).
