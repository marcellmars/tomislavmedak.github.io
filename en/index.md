Welcome to my website. I'm a PhD researcher at the Coventry Unversity's [Centre for Postdigital Cultures](http://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/areas-of-research/postdigital-cultures/), part of the theory and publishing team of [Multimedia Institute/MAMA](http://www.mi2.hr/en/), amateur librarian for the [Memory of the World/Public library](https://memoryoftheworld.org/) project and member of the performative collective [BADco](http://badco.hr/). My work is primarily driven by the activities of those collectivities.

My research interest is in technologies, capitalist development and post-capitalist transition, with a particular focus on economies of intellectual property and unevenness of techno-science. Sometimes I also write and present on theatre, dance and politics. In these pages you will find my writings, information on artworks I contributed to and my professional biography. Click on the sidebar and everything will be revealed.

If you wish to contact me, my details are on the [contact page](/en/contact/).
