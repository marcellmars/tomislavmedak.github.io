Tomislav Medak is a doctoral student at the [Centre for Postdigital
Cultures](http://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/areas-of-research/postdigital-cultures/) at Coventry University. He is also member of the theory and
publishing team of the [Multimedia Institute/MAMA](http://www.mi2.hr/en/) in Zagreb, as well as amateur librarian for the [Memory of the World/Public library](https://memoryoftheworld.org/) project, artist in the performing arts collective [BADco.](http://badco.hr/) and intermittently collaborator of the urban activist initiative Right to the City Zagreb.

With the Multimedia Institute since 2000 he has (co-)organised talks, conferences and exhibitions, as well as (co-)edited publications in the fields of political economy, tactical media and the commons. His scholarship is in technologies, capitalist development and post-capitalist transition, with a particular focus on economies of intellectual property and unevenness of techno-science. At times, he also writes and gives talks on theatre, dance and politics. He's the author of two short books: *The Hard Matter of Abstraction* – *A Guidebook to Domination by Abstraction* (V_____erlag für Handbücher, 2016) and *Shit Tech for A Shitty World* (Aksioma, 2015). Together with Marcell Mars he has co-edited *Public Library* (WHW/Multimedija Institute, 2015), with Petar Milat *The Idea of Radical Media* (Multimedia Institute/Arkzin, 2014) and with Goran Sergej Pristaš *Time and (In)Completion: Images and Performances of Time in Late Capitalism* (BADco., 2014).

Intermittently, he is working as a performer, dramaturge and
director with the Zagreb-based experimental theatre collective BADco. With the collective he has created numerous artworks, including performances *Correcting Rhythm* (2017), *Spores* (2016), *A Pound of Histeria, Acceleration... melodrama* (2014), *The League of Time* (2010) and *1 poor and one 0*. Some of those have toured around Europe, while the interactive installation *Responsibility for Things Seen* was presented in 2011 Venice Biennal.
